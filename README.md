## TODO List

- [x] Add Type Annotations.
- [ ] Implement Task 1.
  - [ ] DFS.
  - [ ] BFS.
- [ ] Implement Task 2.
- [ ] Implement Task 3.

## Notes

- If we implement both DFS and BFS, we can test the implementation since there's definitely a problem if they disagree on the SAT result (i.e, one returns SAT and the other returns UNSAT). Note that they might produce different models.
